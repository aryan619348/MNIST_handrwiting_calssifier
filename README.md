# MNIST_handrwiting_calssifier

Created a MNIST handwritting classifier to introduce myself to tensorflow.js. 
Always wondered how to deploy the models that I have created and came accross tensorflow.js. 
I tweaked the MNIST model that I had worked on before and then used used to tensorflow.js to create a webpage for the model where users can actually draw and test the model in real time. 

To use this webpage I would suggest downloading the Web Server For Chrome:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en

Start a local server at the location where you have downloaded the repository and go to http://127.0.0.1:8887 [OR THE LINK SHOWN IN THE WEB SERVER FOR CHROME APP].
and click on mnist.html

Expected Output:
